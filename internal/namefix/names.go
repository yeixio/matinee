// Package namefix repairs titles read from file and folder names.
//
// Names on disk aren't always written the way a title is. Two kinds of
// difference show up in real libraries:
//
//   - accents written as a letter plus a combining mark (NFD), as macOS
//     and some SMB clients write them, against the single letter (NFC)
//     everything else uses: "Amélie" looks the same either way but isn't
//     the same bytes, so it doesn't match the title online;
//   - garbled names (mojibake), where a tool read UTF-8 as Latin-1 or
//     Windows-1252 and wrote it back: "Æon Flux" became "Ã\u0086on Flux"
//     or "Ã†on Flux", "Léon" "LÃ©on".
